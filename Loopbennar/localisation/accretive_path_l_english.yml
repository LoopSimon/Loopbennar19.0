 accretive_path_acts_of_hermitage_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TActs of Hermitage§!\n--------------\nMonths flow like water, summers and winters passing upon the hermit like rain upon mountains. The body shivers, sweats, suffers, but strengthens nonetheless, and the mind grows as sharp as grassblades. The hermit is isolated, but not useless. They farm, build, study, contemplate as any would, but unburdened by diversion.\n§GWhen Upgraded§!: §YLegitimacy Equivalent§!\nHiring §YAdvisors§! grants §G+25§! Chi (Firing advisors within five years costs §R-25§! Chi)"
 accretive_path_acts_of_hermitage_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TActs of Hermitage§!\n--------------\nYears pass like leaves in the wind, seasons coming and going; the hermit delights in them, but does not grasp for them to stay. The hermit is content, neither distracted nor burdened, as free as a bird. Their body is now perfected, stable as stone, energetic as water, with their mind as flexible as wood and yet harnessing the emotions of fire. And with their very nature as righteous as metal, they have achieved perfection in isolation.\nYearly Legitimacy Equivalent: §G+1.00§!\nYearly Yearly Republican Tradition: §G+0.3§!\nHiring §YAdvisors§! grants §G+25§!

 accretive_path_remembrance_festivals_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TRemembrance Festivals§!\n--------------\nPreparation starts ever earlier, more certain and skilled. Roles are performed like clockwork: painting, dancing, carving, all to a great and knowable design. Gentle laughter fills the air alongside quiet contemplation, yet one does not overpower the other. The celebration makes life more tolerable, burdens and pains easier to bear, though not without cost.\n§GWhen Upgraded§!: §YStability Cost Modifier§!\n§YCoring§! provinces grants §G+10§! Chi"
 accretive_path_remembrance_festivals_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TRemembrance Festivals§!\n--------------\nCycles are determined by the festival, preparations beginning weeks or months in advance. Joy and grief ebb and flow, cycles to be embraced rather than extremes towards which to be drawn. Endless arrays of ceremony and tradition, centuries displayed through controlled creation, lanterns outshining the stars, ancestors and spirits honored and appeased.\nStability Cost Modifier: §G-15.0%§!\n§YCoring§! provinces grants §G+10§!

 accretive_path_sponsor_travelling_libraries_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TSponsor Travelling Libraries§!\n--------------\nThe wagons continue unimpeded, stopped only along rivers and at markets. The darkness is illuminated, the mist parting from the minds they greet. They are hailed wherever they go, whether on tall mountain slopes or along winding forest paths or by harsh desert trails. Ignorance persists, however, and intellectuals are summoned from the capital; ever more lanterns are lit against the dark.\n§GWhen Upgraded§!: §YGlobal Institution Spread§!\nEmbracing §YInstitutions§! grants §G+100§! Chi"
 accretive_path_sponsor_travelling_libraries_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TSponsor Travelling Libraries§!\n--------------\nIllumination covers the land, illustrious and resplendent. Villagers read tomes, scrolls, and books, make notes for themselves, knowledge carrying itself further than the wagons ever could. Like the fireflies that surround the wagon come nightfall, the light of knowledge spreads further and faster now; no need for the lanterns, as unburdened as the rivers and wind.\nGlobal Institution Spread: §G+20.0%§!\nEmbracing §YInstitutions§! grants §G+100§!

 accretive_path_meditation_through_labour_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TMeditation Through Labour§!\n--------------\nBoth are faster now, muscles learning the tasks, the mind free to wander. It ponders the world at first, and then beyond, aligning as trees to the wind. Such labour is intense, however - many need time to recover, rest and regrow.When Upgraded: §YProduction Efficiency§!\nPerforming §YEstate Interactions§! grants §G+15§!

Their mind handles a thousand tasks, failing in none, glorious in its struggle, harmonious in its strife.\nProduction Efficiency: §G+10.0%§!\nPerforming §YEstate Interactions§! grants §G+15§!

 accretive_path_fill_the_begging_bowls_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TFill the Begging Bowls§!\n--------------\nThe fires grow, pots and pans and chopsticks both bought and brought from afar.

Chi"
 accretive_path_fill_the_begging_bowls_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TFill the Begging Bowls§!\n--------------\nExpertly diced spices, masterfully cooked rice - perfection in the grill of the meats.

 relive_past_lives_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TRelive Past Lives§!\n--------------\nSwimming is easier now; push past the rocks and roots, fly through the waters to your goal. Experiences are gleaned, memories earned, lessons learned. How to sort the worms from the cheese?. Many lives are simply ordinary, farmers and miners and slaves, useless. More energy, time, and resources are needed to push past this blockage.\n§GWhen Upgraded§!: §YCost to Promote Culture§!\nPromoting §YCultures§! grants §G+75§! Chi (§R-50§! for demoting cultures)"
 relive_past_lives_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TRelive Past Lives§!\n--------------\nFlow up and down the river, sailing through lives. Righteous heroes and wretched villains, powerful kings and feeble beggars, those who lived long and those who barely got to live at all. No experience is useless, no deed, action, or event unworthy of study or impenetrable in detail. In mastery of every life, preparedness for any situation is guaranteed.\nCost to Promote Culture: §G-20.0%§!\nPromoting §YCultures§! grants §G+75§! Chi (§R-50§! for demoting cultures)"

 accretive_path_universal_martial_education_chi_tt:0 "Winning §YBattles§! grants Chi"
 accretive_path_universal_martial_education_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TUniversal Martial Education§!\n--------------\nThe body moves through the will of the soul; through intentionality there is meaning, and through meaning purpose. To move is to grow, to stop is to become like a stone, devoid of life, devoid of Chi. Thus it is in the best interest of all to keep moving, to not lie still and rot away. Through martial arts the people achieve this, attaining purpose and the strength of cultivated life.\n§GWhen Upgraded§!: §YMorale of Armies§!\nWinning §YBattles§! grants Chi (§G+1§! per 1000 casualties)"
 accretive_path_universal_martial_education_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TUniversal Martial Education§!\n--------------\nRepetition. The body flows as water adjusting to the land; to the world around it. The punch begets footwork. Form follows form. The martial artist becomes akin to a watershed, their body a system. Through each strike flows their cultivated Chi. Through each strike - the fluidity of water. Through repetition, the peoples of our land imbue this creed.\nMorale of Armies: §G+10.0%§!\nWinning §YBattles§! grants Chi (§G+1§! per 1000 casualties)"

 accretive_path_leadership_of_hero_monks_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TLeadership of Hero-Monks§!\n--------------\nThe Monk bends and stoops in the bramble patch.

 accretive_path_leadership_of_hero_monks_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TLeadership of Hero-Monks§!\n--------------\nEach petalled head turns to the sun;seeking its fellows, it reaches for the sustenance.

 accretive_path_hire_sellsword_monks_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§THire Sellsword Monks§!\n--------------\nAlas, too many monks in a regiment will lead to squabbling, like a pot sharing two flowers. There is only so much room before the two roots start to fight for the riches of the soil. We must cultivate our monks as we cultivate our lands, before any dire issues arise.\n§GWhen Upgraded§!: §YMercenary Maintenance§!\nWinning sieges with §YMercenaries§! grants Chi (§G+5§! per fort level)"
 accretive_path_hire_sellsword_monks_improved_hover_tt:0 "§THire Sellsword Monks§!\n--------------\nAs time progresses, two flowers that share a pot either both succeed or both meet their end. Just as we managed to cultivate our state and land, so have we cultivated our Sellswords. Battles and wars have forged of our fractious monks fierce brothers-in-arms. A blooming future awaits.\nMercenary Maintenance: §G-20%§!\nWinning sieges with §YMercenaries§! grants Chi (§G+5§! per fort level)"

 accretive_path_liberation_of_the_mind_hover_tt:0 "§TLiberation of the Mind§!\n--------------\nThe mind is one of the simplest and yet most complex things. Like a fishing pole, one fishes to feed oneself. But a fisherman too focused upon his task will soon be swallowed into the sea. An inexperienced fisherman either comes back home or he can feed himself and let the sea take over.\nMonarch Administrative Skill: §G+1§!\nDeveloping §YTax§! grants §G+15§! Chi"

 accretive_path_liberation_of_the_soul_hover_tt:0 "§TLiberation of the Soul§!\n--------------\nThe true liberation of the soul lies in the harmony of the mind and body. Each yearns for its own substance, but cannot exist without the other. It is our duty to discipline ourselves and harmonise these two opposing forces, so that our spirits may be made free.\nMonarch Diplomatic Skill: §G+1§!\nDeveloping §YProduction§! grants §G+15§! Chi"

 accretive_path_liberation_of_the_body_hover_tt:0 "§TLiberation of the Body§!\n--------------\nOnly once the whole temple is planned is the foundation built upon;  without planning, the Temple would never hold the Mind and Spirit. Too small a foundation and the Temple does not fit upon it. Too broad, and one wastes too many resources to be able to afford the Temple itself. Every temple has its own foundation;  as we study them, we learn about ourselves. Otherwise all will crumble sooner or later.\nMonarch Military Skill: §G+1§!\nDeveloping §YManpower§! grants §G+15§! Chi"

 accretive_path_river_flows_in_you_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TRiver Flows in You§!\n--------------\nJust as with rivers, if there is too much water, the banks will burst, overflowing and causing immense damage along its path.In such a time, the bountiful waters of the river will spill over borders, uncontrolled.\n§GWhen Upgraded§!: §YTrade Steering§!\nUpgrading §YCenters of Trade§! grants §G+25§! Chi"
 accretive_path_river_flows_in_you_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TYanhe Flows in You§!\n--------------\nOver time, even rivers born of calamity will settle down. A strong path is carved from the ground, worn of years of unruly and overflowing waters running its course. As such, it is no surprise that many monks look upon a river and its reflection, and take inspiration from it in the cultivation of their chi.\nTrade Steering: §G+10.0%§!\nUpgrading §YCenters of Trade§! grants §G+25§! Chi"

 accretive_path_words_aflame_chi_tt:0 "Upgrading a §YTechnology§! grants §G+50§! Chi"
 accretive_path_words_aflame_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TWords Aflame§!\n--------------\nThoughts can consume — and through that consumption breed obsession. The Gangim people harness this to great effect through a form of meditative practice performed within hot springs; they channel their inner Chi towards fanning that flame of obsession, the flame of single-minded purpose which fuels innovation and discovery.\nhen Upgraded: §YTechnology Cost§!\nUpgrading a §YTechnology§! grants §G+50§! Chi"
 accretive_path_words_aflame_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TWords Ablaze§!\n--------------\nA curious mind burns; words and thoughts flow through their being; the flame fuels ever greater heights of achievement. Most fires of this sort are rapidly reduced to cinders, but not here, where the flame is ever-supplied with fuel. The Chi of the self, the Chi of the hot spring waters, the Chi of the nature that pervades all, may flow into, and out of it. As above, so below.\nTechnology Cost: §G-5.0%§!\nUpgrading a §YTechnology§! grants §G+50§! Chi"

 accretive_path_serenity_in_rock_and_stone_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TSerenity in This Keep§!\n--------------\nAnd as we build them up, manning such walls comes at a price. Just as in nature, all things come at a cost. We are moving just earth and rock, but people and families, barracks and armories, smiths and their tools. Are we able to take on such a burden.\n§GWhen Upgraded§!: §YGarrison Size§!\nBuilding §YFort§! buildings grants §G+20§! Chi"
 accretive_path_serenity_in_rock_and_stone_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TSerenity in Rock and Stone§!\n--------------\nAnd over time, our dedication and mastery has cultivated our knowledge.

 accretive_path_the_second_ascension_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TPath of the Ascension§!\n--------------\nBut unlike some animals, blessed with long lives, people are invisibly bound to a clock. Some are even able to feel this binding, and will tug against its tension, writhing and contorting in unseemly ways. Such movements are visible, unlike the threads of time and death.\n§GWhen Upgraded§!: §YAverage Monarch Lifespan§!\nUpgrading a §YMonument§! grants §G+100§! Chi"
 accretive_path_the_second_ascension_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TThe Second Ascension§!\n--------------\nBut like the Monks, with care and cultivation, learning from the deeds and actions of those that came before,we can build a temple of knowledge. We can grow comfortable in our binding, slackening the string for just a few more hours before the clock ticks down. This is at least enough time to prepare the next of us, and leave the care of the Temple to the next as we move on.\nAverage Monarch Lifespan: §G+15.0%§!\nUpgrading a §YMonument§! grants §G+100§! Chi"

 accretive_path_tea_ceremonies_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TTea Ceremonies§!\n--------------\nThe tradition expands; many kettles boil throughout the village, experienced preparation of newer blends. A group sits down, the host passing the kettle around, doling out the brew. A guest graciously thanks him, bringing his cup to his lips. He spits out the tea; a yet-to-be acquired taste.\n§GWhen Upgraded§!: §YDomestic Trade Power§!\nBuilding §YProduction Manufactories§! grants §G+25§! Chi"
 accretive_path_tea_ceremonies_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TTea Rituals§!\n--------------\nGrand preparation, elaborate blends and flavors, techniques tinkered with for decades by masters of their craft.

Greed runs rampant, however. Many cannot resist the allure of wealth, climbing all the way simply to snatch stray scales, trinkets to be sold at lowland marketplaces.\n§GWhen Upgraded§!: §YPrestige Decay§!\nRepaying §YLoans§! grants §G+10§!

 accretive_path_sages_of_the_misty_mountains_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TSages of the Misty Mountains§!\n--------------\nThe men and women weave up the mountains, dancing across peril, water flowing to the highest ground.
